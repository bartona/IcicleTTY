While analyzing gated clock network, ambiguities have been found on gates
display0/address_RNI9DH1[3]:Y, un15_curpos_I_5:Y, char_rom0/data4_3:Y, un15_curpos_I_7:Y,
display0/address_RNIMEN1[5]:Y, display0/address_RNIUGQ1[6]:Y, un15_curpos_I_12:Y,
char_rom0/data4_1:Y.
The timing models of these gates have been simplified for Static Timing Analysis.
